### Advanced Computer Network Project

This project involves advanced concepts of networking whereby we try to implement a MPQUIC network involving 2 different hosts. We try to measure the bandwidth and the efficiency of the proposed network on mininet, netem & iperf and try to improvise upon the existing MPQUIC scheduling algorithms, if any.
